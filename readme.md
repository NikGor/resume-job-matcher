## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.6 or higher
- **APIs**:
  - [Anthropic Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/product)
- **Python Packages**:
  - `PyPDF2`
  - `anthropic`
  - `tqdm`
  - `termcolor`
  - `json5`
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sliday/resume-job-matcher.git
cd resume-job-matcher
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 anthropic tqdm termcolor json5 requests beautifulsoup4
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Set your Claude API key as an environment variable:

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**On Windows:**

```cmd
set CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual Claude API key.

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Job Description

Create a file named `job_description.txt` in the project directory containing the job description. This file should include:

- Job title
- Required skills
- Optional skills
- Preferred certifications
- Soft skills
- Required education level
- Required years of experience
- Emphasis weights for different criteria

**Example `job_description.txt`:**

```
Senior Machine Learning Engineer

We are looking for a senior machine learning engineer with at least 5 years of experience in machine learning, data analysis, and software development.

Required Skills:
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Deep Learning

Optional Skills:
- Cloud Computing
- Big Data
- Computer Vision

Certifications Preferred:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- Certified Data Scientist

Soft Skills:
- Communication
- Team Leadership
- Problem Solving
- Adaptability

Required Education Level:
- Masters

Required Experience Years:
- 5

Emphasis:
- Technical Skills Weight: 50
- Soft Skills Weight: 20
- Experience Weight: 20
- Education Weight: 10
```

### 2. Place Resumes in the Source Directory

Create a directory named `src` (if it doesn't exist) and place all PDF resumes you want to process inside this directory.

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
python resume_matcher.py [path_to_job_description] [path_to_resumes]
```

- **`path_to_job_description`**: (Optional) Path to the job description file. Default is `job_description.txt`.
- **`path_to_resumes`**: (Optional) Path to the directory containing resume PDFs. Default is `src`.

**Example:**

```bash
python resume_matcher.py job_description.txt src
```

If you don't provide any arguments, the script will default to `job_description.txt` and `src`.

### 4. View Results

The script will process the resumes and display the results in the terminal, including:

- Candidate name (from the resume filename)
- Match score with an emoji and label
- Key reasons for the match (if score > 80%)
- Any detected personal website status

Personalized email responses are saved in the `out` directory, named after each resume.

## Advanced Features

### Multiprocessing

- Utilizes all available CPU cores to process resumes in parallel, improving efficiency.

### Comprehensive Scoring System

- **Dynamic Weights**: Adjusts scoring weights based on emphasis provided in the job description.
- **Criteria Evaluated**:
  - Language proficiency
  - Education level
  - Years of experience
  - Technical skills (required and optional)
  - Certifications
  - Soft skills
  - Relevance of experience

### Website Content Integration

- **Personal Websites**: If a personal website URL is found in a resume, the script will:
  - Check if the website is active.
  - Fetch and include website content in the evaluation.
  - Penalize the score if the website is inactive.

### Detailed Logging and Error Handling

- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels (`CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`).
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles exceptions without stopping the entire process.

### Personalized Candidate Communication

- Generates professional, personalized email responses based on the match score.
- Saves responses in the `out` directory for easy access.

## Customization

### Adjust Logging Level

Modify the logging level at the beginning of the script:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

Available levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

### Change Scoring Model

To change the AI model used, update the `model` parameter in the `match_resume_to_job` function:

```python
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    ...
)
```

### Modify Scoring Criteria

Adjust the scoring logic in the `match_resume_to_job` function's prompt as needed to better fit your specific requirements.

## Output Interpretation

- **Emojis and Labels**: Each candidate is assigned an emoji and label based on their score.
  - Example: `ðŸŒŸðŸš€ candidate.pdf : 98% - Cosmic Perfection`

- **Match Reasons**: For candidates scoring above 80%, key reasons for the match are displayed.

- **Website Status**:
  - Active websites are included in the evaluation.
  - Inactive or unreachable websites result in a score penalty and are marked as `(inactive)`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No Resumes Found**: Ensure that resume PDFs are placed in the correct directory (`src` by default).
- **Job Description Not Found**: Confirm that `job_description.txt` exists in the script's directory or provide the correct path.
- **API Key Errors**: Verify that the `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly.
- **Dependency Errors**: Install all required Python packages using `pip`.

### Adjusting Timeouts and Retries

If you experience network-related errors when fetching personal websites, you may adjust the `timeout` parameter in the `check_website` function.

```python
response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
```

## Best Practices

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that all candidate data is handled in compliance with relevant data protection laws and regulations.
- **API Usage**: Be mindful of API rate limits and usage policies when using the Anthropic Claude API.
